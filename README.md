# PMU v1: Bitstream Loader with JTAG interface

This is the first interation of the PMU (v1). This architecture will serve the basic purpose of loading a bitstream to an FPGA core with "scan chain" configuration protocol. It will use protocol to facilitate the interface between the Host PC and the FPGA Core.
